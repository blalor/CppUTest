Example description
===================
This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral and
gives an example how to configure the ADC in continuous mode and using the 
interrupt feature.

The example permits to convert the analog signal issued from a potentiometer (AN_TR on
the STR912-SK-IAR board) and connected to the channel 5 (P4.5 pin 126) of the ADC.


When the conversion is finished an interrupt is generated. In the ADC interrupt 
service routine, the converted value is then used to set the pulse of TIM0 which 
is configured in PWM mode.

You can see the PWM signal generated by the timer in the P3.0 pin (variation of 
luminosity in LED1 on the STR912-SK-IAR board).
